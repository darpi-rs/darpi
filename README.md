### darpi

A web api framework with speed and safety in mind.
One of the big goals is to catch all errors at `compile time`, if possible.
The framework uses [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) and ideally, the performance should be as if you were using `hyper` yourself.
The framework also uses [shaku](https://github.com/Mcat12/shaku) for `compile time` verifiable dependency injection.

### The framework is in early development and will only be updated on github, until it's stable.
All feedback is appreciated.
